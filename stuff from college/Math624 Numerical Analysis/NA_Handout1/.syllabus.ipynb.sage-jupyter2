Syllabus\n### Practical Information\n<ul>\n    <li>Math 624 is scheduled to meet Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:40-2:25 in Kiely 220</li>\n    <li>Office Hours: Tuesday and Thursday 12:40-1:40 in Kiely 607</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Prerequisites\nMath 624 is a graduate course in Numerical Analysis.  Students are expected to have a good working knowledge of linear algebra and calculus and be comfortable with mathematical definitions, theorems, and proofs.  \n\nProgramming experience is not assumed, but programming will be required in this course.\n\n### References\nNo books are required for the course, but two are recommended.  First, <cite>Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers</cite>, by R. W. Hamming, which is an inexpensive book published by Dover.  The motto of Hamming's book is\n<blockquote><em>The purpose of computation is insight, not numbers.</em></blockquote>\nThe second recommended book is <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.csp\">A Whirlwind Tour of Python</a> by Jake VanderPlas, a free ebook published by O'Reilly.\n\n### Material\nI expect that we will cover the basics of numerical analysis, including iterative methods for solving equations and finding eigenvectors, polynomial approximation, optimization via gradient descent, and some Monte Carlo methods. \n\n### Coursework\nGrades will be determined by work on several projects, probably four.","cell_type":"markdown"}

{"type":"cell","id":"32d27f","pos":7,"input":"Computer programming experience is not a pre-requisite, but programming will be essential for success in this course.  This semester we'll be using python to write code.  Python is a high level, interpreted programming language with sophisticated libraries for doing numerical, symbolic, and scientific computing.  Moreover, python has some advanced interactive programming environments that combine code and documentation together that will make it easy for us to use.\n\nThe main python reference for this course is a free ebook published by O'Reilly:\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.csp\">A Whirlwind Tour of Python</a> by Jake VanderPlas.</li>\n</ul>\n\nYou won't have to learn everything about programming at the beginning, but it will be helpful if you can get acquainted with python basics in the first week.  To do so, work through the following sections of <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.csp\">A Whirlwind Tour of Python</a>:\n\n<ul>\n    <li>A Quick Tour of Python Language Syntax p7</li>\n    <li>Basic Python Semantics: Variables and Objects p13 </li>\n    <li>Basic Python Semantics: Operators p17</li>\n</ul>\n\nIt's not necessary to install anything on your computer in order to use python.  You can just go to your CoCalc account, create a Jupyter notebook and immediately have access to an interpretive python environment.  You'll want to know that code is executed in a Jupyter notebook by pressing SHIFT-return or using the play button.  If you've accepted the invitation to join the NumericalAnalysis.course in CoCalc, you'll see a Jupyter notebook called pythonbasics.ipynb which you can work through.\n\nIf you want more information about python, I suggest starting with the official python website <a href=\"https://www.python.org\">www.python.org</a> and working through the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html\">tutorial</a>.  If you like videos, there's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4mEzFDjqtA\">Python Programming</a>, which is about an hour long.  If you have a bit more time, you can check out <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/edu/python/\">Google's python course</a>, which has accompanying videos and exercises.","cell_type":"markdown"}
